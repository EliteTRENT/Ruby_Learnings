Task 1: 
Scaffolding 
It generates a controller for the model with standard RESTful actions which allows CRUD operations
Can be seen in the file (./app/controllers/notes_controller.rb)
Working:
Start the rails server, follow the local host link then append "/model_name" which is "/notes" in our case.
